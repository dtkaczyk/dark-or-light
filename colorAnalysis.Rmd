This document contains the analysis of colors' brightness. The main problem is the following: how can we
automatically decide whether the color is dark or light given it's R, G, B components.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t <- read.csv("data/data.csv", header=FALSE)
t <- t[,c(2,3,4,5)]
colnames(t) <- c("R", "G", "B", "L")
summary(t)
```
